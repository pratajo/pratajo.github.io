The LAMP stack is a set of programs for web development. It consists of Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. Together, they allow you to manage a web server.

This article shows you how to install and configure the Apache web server, PHP and MySQL on Fedora.

###### **Install Apache**

```bash
sudo dnf install httpd
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
```

```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd.service
```

To check that the HTTP server is working correctly, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd.service
```

(press the Q key to exit and return to the terminal prompt)

or open the link [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

&nbsp;

###### **Install PHP**

```bash
sudo dnf install php php-cli php-common php-opcache php-fpm php-mysqlnd php-pecl-zip php-devel php-gd php-pecl-mcrypt php-mbstring php-curl php-xml php-pear php-bcmath php-json
```

Test PHP by creating a document in /var/www/html with the command:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/html/info.php
```

and using the function phpinfo()

```php
<?php
    phpinfo();
?>
```

Restart your Apache server to ensure it works with the new PHP installed.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
```

Open the link [http://localhost/info.php](http://localhost/info.php)

You will get a page with the PHP version and system data.

###### **Configure MariaDB**

Start the database with:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

and check its operation:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

Run the security script before first use with

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

and answer the following questions:

- Enter password for user root - Press the Enter key. As the command is running with sudo privileges, the password is not required.
- Switch to unit_socket authentication - N
- Change the root password? - N. It is safe to allow local sudo access with the default root password.
- Remove anonymous users? - Y
- Disallow root login remotely? - Y
- Remove test database and access to it? - Y
- Reload privilege tables now? - Y

Access the database with:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

Create a database, e.g. website.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE website;
```

MySQL should answer ‘Query OK’ after each line.

Create a user account for the web application to access. Provide a username and a secure password, both enclosed in single commas (’x‘).

```sql
CREATE USER 'username' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Finally, grant all rights to the user.

```sql
GRANT ALL ON website.* TO 'username';
```

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Exit the SQL shell and return to the terminal prompt.

```sql
quit
```

###### **Check LAMP stack installation**

To check the components of the LAMP stack, embed a block of PHP code containing a database connection, within an HTML page. PHP code can be integrated into an HTML file using the tag <?php. The PHP code block can then connect to an SQL-based database using the command mysqli_connect. Provide the correct database credentials for the connection.

To test all components of the LAMP stack, follow these steps:

1. In Terminal, change to the directory var/www/html and create a new file, now the phptest.php

```bash
cd /var/www/html
```

```bash
sudo nano phptest.php
```

2. Add the following content to the file. Confirm that the servername variable is set to localhost. Replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with the credentials for the WEB database user account (not the root password).

```php
<html>
  <head>
    <title>PHP Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <?php echo '<p>Welcome to the Site!</p>';
        $servername = "localhost";
        $username = "USERNAME";
        $password = "PASSWORD";
        // Create the MySQL connection
        $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password);
        // If the conn variable is empty, the connection has failed. The output for the failure case includes the error message
        if (!$conn) {
            die('<p>Connection failed: </p>' . mysqli_connect_error());
        }
        echo '<p>Connected successfully</p>';
        ?>
  </body>
</html>
```

3. Run the LAMP stack script test by opening the link [http://localhost/phptest.php](http://localhost/phptest.php)

4. If the test is successful, the browser displays the message:

```bash
       Welcome to the site!
       Connected successfully
```
