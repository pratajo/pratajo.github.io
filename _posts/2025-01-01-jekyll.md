[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a generator of static sites, with blog recognition, for personal sites, projects or organizations, with support for GitHub.

&nbsp;

###### **Installing Jekyll**

These instructions apply to Fedora 41 KDE Plasma.

```bash
sudo dnf group install development-tools
```

```bash
sudo dnf install ruby ruby-devel openssl-devel redhat-rpm-config gcc-c++
```

Avoid installing RubyGems packages (called gems) as the root user. Instead, set up a gem installation directory in your user account.  
The following commands add environment variables to your ~/. bashrc to configure the gem installation path. Run the commands with your user:

```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally install Jekyll.

```bash
jekyll new mysite
```

```bash
cd mysite
```

```bash
~/mysite$ bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Create a folder with the name, for example, “mysite”, for the Jekyll website. Enter the folder and build the website.

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/jekyll2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
The theme installed by default: minima
</div>

&nbsp;

###### **Host a website on GitHub**

Create a new public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/), in the format _username_.github.io, where _username_ is your username.

Install the GitHub CLI (gh) and run it to automatically store your credentials on GitHub. You can then choose HTTPS as your preferred protocol for Git operations, and answer "yes" to the prompt that will ask if you would like to authenticate to Git with your GitHub credentials.

```bash
sudo dnf install gh
```

```bash
gh auth login
```

Select the following answers to the following questions:

Where do you use GitHub? **GitHub.com**  
What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host? **HTTPS**  
Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? **Yes**  
How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? **Login with a web browser**  
! First copy your one-time code: XXXX-XXXX (It is a code with letters and numbers that will be used in the browser in the next step, right after authenticating.)
Press Enter to open https://github.com/login/device in your browser...
✓ Authentication complete.

Initialize the Git repository and sync the site.

```bash
~/mysite$ git init
```

```bash
~/mysite$ git checkout -b master
```

```bash
~/mysite$ git status
```

```bash
~/mysite$ git add .
```

```bash
~/mysite$ git config --global user.email "me@example.com"
```

```bash
~/mysite$ git config --global user.name "my username"
```

```bash
~/mysite$ git commit -m "Commit inicial"
```

```bash
~/mysite$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
```

```bash
~/mysite$ git push -u origin master
```

&nbsp;

###### **Clone a GitHub Pages site locally**

After creating the site on GitHub, we can clone the site locally. To do this, go to the folder where you want to store the project and clone the new repository. In this example I will do the cloning inside the “mysite” folder. Cloning will automatically create a folder named _username_.github.io

```bash
~/mysite$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```

After you create or change a file, for example index.html, push the new file or new version to GitHub.

```bash
~/mysite$ cd username.github.io
```

```bash
~/mysite/username.github.io$ git add index.html (if it is a new file)
```

```bash
~/mysite/username.github.io$ git commit index.html -m “Initial commit”
```

```bash
~/mysite/username.github.io$ git push origin master
```

And we have the website at https://_username_.github.io

❗ If you come across "error: pathspect 'commit' did not match any file(s) known to git", write the command manually in Terminal instead of copying/pasting from the website.

###### **Uninstalling Jekyll**

```bash
gem uninstall jekyll
```
