For photo restoration, it is essential to install the _Resynthesizer_ plug-in in GIMP.

On Fedora, the best way to get Resynthesizer is to install the flatpack version through Discover.

Its use is very well demonstrated in a Davis MediaDesign [film](https://daviesmediadesign.com/video-tutorials/gimp-2-10-tutorial-restore-and-repair-old-photos-with-severe-damage/).

I recommend scanning each photo in two formats, tiff and jpeg, both without compression and in the following resolutions:

- on paper - maximum 900 dpi (no higher resolution required)
- slides and negatives - 2,000 dpi or more

Regarding the export of the photos in GIMP, I recommend reading the chapter "6. Getting Images out of GIMP" of the User Manual.
