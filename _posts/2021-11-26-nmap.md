[Nmap](https://nmap.org/) (Network Mapper) is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.  
It is a network scanner, used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

&nbsp;

###### **Install the Nmap application**

```bash
sudo dnf install nmap
ls
```

General network discovery:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV --allports -T4 192.164.1.0/24
```

Wait for the result.
