If we forget to customize the machine name during the installation of the operating system, we can do it later. The easiest method is using the command line.

This instruction is valid for a computer used at home, which is not part of a enterprise network. We use the _hostnamectl_ command:

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname new-name
```

This name is stored in the /etc/hostname file.

We can simultaneously check the machine name, operating system, kernel version and architecture with this command:

```bash
hostnamectl status
```
